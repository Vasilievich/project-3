## Prompt

With your teammates, you will work together to design, architect, and test any E-Commerce website of your choice using the Selenium testing framework.

**Here are some examples of use-cases that you might want to consider:**

Testing Registration and Login to the Online Shopping Website
 - Can a guest purchase products as a guest user?
 - Is it easy for guests to register on the website?

Testing the Search feature of the Online Shopping Website

 - Does the website have multiple filters for searching products such as price ranges, categories, brands, etc.?
 - After applying one or more search filters, are relevant products displayed?
 - Would it be possible to display a fixed number of products on the search page once the product has been selected?
 - Do you have a sort option available on the search page, and if so, is it working correctly?
   
Test the product details page of the online shopping site on which you will be shopping
 - Can you confirm that the page displays all the information about the product on that page?
 - Are the products available in different sizes, colors, and quantities that the user can choose from?
 - Does the page display any offers if they apply to the product you are looking at
 - Does the stock information on the page appear to be correct?
 - After adding the product to the cart, does it appear in the cart as well?
   
Testing the Shopping Cart of the e-commerce website
 - Does the correct price for the selected product/s appear in the shopping cart when selecting an item?
 - Is there a way to apply a coupon code to my order?
 - Is it possible for a user to increase or decrease the quantity of a product

## Requirements

You should 

- Utilize unit tests and the Selenium library to test different use cases for different use stories
- Use appropriate naming conventions, docstrings, and OO principles should be followed
- Generate the testing reports that are required as part of the testing process
- Make use of a test suite that has multiple test cases with one test suite
- Manage your code base by using GitHub branches
- The necessary `requirements.txt` file should be generated

### Planning requirements

As you've discovered, a project consists of more than just code.

This project requires planning organized within the **GitHub projects** with the following lists:

- **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the Current/MVP list. All user stories are originally put into the Icebox, including both MVP and wish list stories.
- **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP
  has been met, additional user stories may be moved to this list from the Icebox.
- **Completed**: Holds completed user stories.

Important: User stories need to be formed properly using this template: 
```
    As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.
```

### Presentation requirements - 03/06/2023 at 11:00 PM EST

You will have 12 minutes to present and demonstrate the following:

- Introduce your project by paraphrasing its `README.md`.
- Share project workflow.
- Demonstrate your Selenium test features.
- Share/discuss the following code.

Share the experience by answering the following:

- What was your biggest challenge?
- What are your key learnings/takeaways?
- Following your presentation, there may be a brief Q & A period and optional instructor feedback.

### Version control requirements

- The project's source code must be hosted on a GHE account.
- The repo is to contain **frequent commits dated from the beginning of the project through its completion**.
- Do not **start over** by _replacing the repository_ with a different one.
- Overall project must have at least **40 commits**


## Suggestions for Success

1. **Use [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming)** where the team is always developing together on a single computer.  Read [this post](http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/06/01/mob-programming/) for more information.  **All students will get more out of the project by following Mob Programming!**  Be sure to rotate who the driver is (typing the code) frequently so that every team member makes commits on the project.

2.  **Identify roles** on the team, which may be:
    - **GitHub Manager (required role)**: the primary person for "owning"/managing the repo and GitHub team workflow (merging pull requests, etc.).
    - **Tester 1**: 
    - **Tester 2**: 
    - **Tester 3**: 

4. For help with implementing a test feature, review the relevant lesson(s), read the docs, then Google only if necessary.

5.  **Be consistent with your code style.** You have multiple developers in your team writing code, but you only have one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort in regards to formatting, etc.  For example, consistent vertical whitespace between functions.

6. Do your best to have only one dev working on a certain file between commits.  This will avoid merge conflicts. This is another reason to use Mob Programming!

7. **Commit early, commit often.**


### Self-sufficiency / Project assistance

- At this stage being able to find the answers to development issues is of paramount importance.
- Use all resources available to solve the issue on your own before seeking assistance.
- If you do seek assistance in Slack, use the support channel and explain the issue as clearly and detailed as you can,
  include screenshots when possible, and be prepared to explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.
